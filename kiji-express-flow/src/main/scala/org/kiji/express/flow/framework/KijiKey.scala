/**
 * A reusable container for [[org.kiji.schema.EntityId]]s.

 * and likes to read those pairs into a reusable instance of the key or value class. When a row
 * is read from a Kiji table, its [[org.kiji.schema.EntityId]] is emitted as the key, and
 * [[org.kiji.schema.KijiRowData]] is emitted as the value. Because instances of
 * [[org.kiji.schema.EntityId]] are not reusable, this class is provided to give the MapReduce
 * framework a reusable container.
