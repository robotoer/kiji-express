/**
 * Reads a colon-separated list of classpath entries and outputs comma-separated list of
 * URIs to jar files accessible from that classpath, as well as the HBase library jars.
 *
 * This tool is meant to be used to specify a collection of jars that should be included on the
 * distributed cache of Hadoop jobs run through KijiExpress. It should be used from the `express`
 * script and should be passed a classpath entry for the KijiExpress `lib` directory as well
 * as any classpath entries specified by the user through `EXPRESS_CLASSPATH`.
 *
 * Classpath entries can come in one of three forms:
 *
 * 1. A path to a specific file. In this case we send the file through the distributed cache if
 * it is a jar.
 * 2. A path to a directory. Since directory entries do not include jars on the classpath,
 * we send no jars through the distributed cache.
 * 3. A path to a directory with the wildcard * appended. In this case all jars under the
 * specified directory are sent through the distributed cache.
 *
 * This tool accepts one command line argument: a string containing a colon-separated list of
 * classpath entries.
