/**
 * KijiExpress is a domain-specific language for analyzing and modeling data stored in Kiji.
 *
 * For more information on Kiji, please visit [[http://www.kiji.org]] and the Kiji Github page at
 * [[https://github.com/kijiproject]]. KijiExpress is built atop Scalding
 * ([[https://github.com/twitter/scalding]]), a library for writing MapReduce workflows.
 *
 * === Getting started. ===
 * To use KijiExpress, import the Scalding library, the `express` library, and members of the
 * flow module [[org.kiji.express.flow]].
 * {{{
 *   import com.twitter.scalding._
 *   import org.kiji.express._
 *   import org.kiji.express.flow._
 * }}}
 * Doing so will import several classes and functions that make it easy to author analysis
 * pipelines.
 *
 * === Working with data from a Kiji table. ===
 * Scalding represents distributed data sets as a collection of tuples with named fields.
 * Likewise, KijiExpress represents a row in a Kiji table as a tuple.
 * [[org.kiji.express.flow]] provides a factory, named `KijiInput`,
 * that make it easy to specify what columns you want to read from a Kiji table and what names
 * they should have in row tuples. For example, to read the value of a column named `info:text`
 * from a table named `postings` into the tuple field named `text`, you could write the following.
 *
 * {{{
 *   KijiInput("kiji://.env/default/postings", "info:text" -> "text")
 * }}}
 *
 * The result of the above expression is a [[org.kiji.express.flow.KijiSource]] (an implementation
 * of Scalding's `Source`) which represents the rows of the Kiji table as a collection of tuples.
 * At this point, functional operators can be used to manipulate and analyze the data. For example,
 * to split the contents of the column `info:text` into individual words,
 * you could write the following.
 * {{{
 *   KijiInput("kiji://.env/default/postings")("info:text" -> 'text)
 *       .flatMap('text -> 'word) { word: Seq[FlowCell[String]] =>
 *         word.head.datum.split("""\s+""")
 *       }
 * }}}
